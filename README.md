# Retail Sales Performance Dashboard (2014–2017)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how BeyondStatistics helps SMEs turn raw sales data into actionable insights.  
A mid-sized retailer was struggling with frequent stockouts, overstocking of slow-moving items, and limited visibility into branch-level performance.  

We built a **Retail Sales Performance Dashboard** to highlight what’s selling, what’s wasting money, and where to focus next.
